# Todo App

Simple TODO app in knockout, jquery, and, sammy.js. This POC shows you can employ knockout's navtive templating engine to bind to views, which I thought was cool. 

No need of webpack, angular, and, blah, blah if your project is really small...

You could take this a step further, use es6 module imports and everything (further requiring webpack bunding and all), but let that be your homework.
